#id.cv Gigs: A Decentralized Freelancer Job Portal Built on StarkNet
##Introduction
id.cv Gigs is an innovative decentralized freelancer job portal developed by the same team that created the id.cv decentralized resume platform during HackFS. This project is being further developed during StarkHack, leveraging the capabilities of StarkNet to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for companies and freelancers to connect and collaborate. Our goal with id.cv Gigs is to ensure trust, transparency, and security for all users.

##Key Features
